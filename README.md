# EpicTD
This project was carried out as a course work on programming.
### The main essence of the project
Epic TD is a strategy game in which the player's goal is to protect the main base from enemy attacks. To do this, the player builds defensive structures along the trajectory of the attack.
The game is in the prototype stage and may be completely rewritten in the future.
